REVOLUTION IS COMMING!

The purpose that I want to achieve is to give the power of processing data back to user-selves.
As the highest principle, the project will be completely open source either server or client side.
The server side will focus on delivering messages rather than limiting and knowing users. 
The client side will open to user, so it will be plug-in structure. The third party can provide new feature for users.
I will follow up and push the project online soon.

Plans:
Server side initiate and features added up.
Client side development.
Client plug-in support, Web/Android/iOS/Linux/Windows client support. maybe the Web is the first version as demonstration.

P2P message transfer support: after the connection been established, then users communication via P2P network or an agent.
Built-in VPN support, can support stream message.

THE BEST YET TO COME.
